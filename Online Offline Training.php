We, at RineX, know how much your mode of study can play a role not only during your learning but also how the hiring companies might perceive it as.

      <h3 class="mb-0 mt-4">Study space management</h3>
      <p>Sometimes students might have to relocate for study purposes, but sometimes that would not be possible owing to your prior commitment. It gets as simple as travel and study away for offline mode and arrange your study space wherever you want for online mode. Choose it well as per your conveniences and needs.

      <h3 class="mb-0 mt-4">Timescale flexibility</h3>
      <p>Time preferences go both ways, as in, convenient for both the trainer and the student, for both of them could be working professionals too. Well, some of the courses do give you videos that you could revisit and learn. Convenient batch days and timings need to be checked prior to admission. This is why the majority of the student population now chooses to learn online. This flexibility gives you the option for career advancement and even hobbies. Also in online students get to have continual support via mail or chat systems from the trainers and also individual attention.</p>

      <h3 class="mb-0 mt-4">Remote reachability</h3>	
      <p>
      Considering the worldwide student strength, imagine you would want to join an online certification course in probably the USA or UK, it is made possible through online education despite you probably doing a full-time degree or a job here. Also, you won’t be the only person learning from another country. Could you imagine any physical university or college able to hold such a huge number of students? No campus is large enough to fit.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mb-0 mt-4">Active and passive learning</h3>	
      <p>
      The current educational system has become so rigid that the companies look for a degree to provide you with a job and the universities have become a place where you get the degree. With the current market changes, post-Covid, it seems to us that continual active learning along with the support of passive learning is provided by most online educational institutes, we do agree it is a quite recent development as a market advantage.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mb-0 mt-4">Stay with the trend</h3>	
      <p>
      Considering today’s world of instant gratification and marked transformation, educational curriculums need to be updated regularly. It seems as though as if there is a new study subject arising every day with much more scope. So when it comes to staying with the trend, it is always better to opt for an online mode of learning, as these online platforms are pretty quick in introducing new certification courses. Whereas, in an offline university it would take almost two years, to fit this new study-subject in the existing curriculum, which will lead it to be outdated.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mb-0 mt-4">Working professionals who are trainers</h3>	
      <p>
     When the course offered is online, time flexibility applies to the trainer as well. So the trainers here have the advantage to be both an active industry working professional and a part-time trainer. So the students gather the advantage of learning from industry experts who regularly update themselves with the market trends. Whereas, in Offline training, the faculty member is in a situation to be a full-time trainer.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mb-0 mt-4">Theory and practical learning </h3>	
      <p>
      Not all the courses are suitable for learning online as some study subjects need equal exposures to the practical sessions of learning as well. That is why a hybrid structure of mode of learning, that is, both online and offline together serves to be the best way of learning those specific topics.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mb-0 mt-4">Oriented and cost-effective courses</h3>	
      <p>
      Usually, the online courses have dedicated subject speciality and give you the knowledge you need to know in a linear method, i.e. the complete package. And thus these courses are even cost-worthy, unlike any other offline courses which are usually highly charged considering their infrastructure and faculty expenses.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mb-0 mt-4">Tests and evaluations</h3>	
      <p>
      Online tests are simpler to conduct as well as attend, and even the evaluation and the declaration of the results are considerably faster than offline methods. Cheaper costs of exams, avoiding evaluation errors, and preventing the risk of question paper leak are the additional advantages of these online tests compared to offline ones.
      </p>
      <p>
      Concluding, Online education is considered to be the future of learning. Now that during Covid, even the offline institutes have started teaching via online methods, it is sure that they stand a chance in the market because as of now the trend in the educational training systems is noticed to be equally online and offline training – the blended learning, which has developed to be a considerate learning and effective experience. Here you get both self-based learning and interactive learning. But do note that, what we ideally recommend considering the Indian Educational System is that you need to manage to learn a full-time degree in offline
       and certification courses in online modes simultaneously.
